  ## Installation
  The way the project works, first the user  will need to clone it into the users local repo, from there they must run npm insatall so all the proper npm packages can be instealled. Once everything there is done, you start off by running npm run seed to create all the databases. Also, be sure to source the schema file in the command line and procceed. After all this, run node server.js and port will begin to listen. From here open insomnia and check that the routes work.

  ## Usage
  It is the backend of an e-commerce site that connects the routes of the information needed.
